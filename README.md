# behavior_tree_package

## Description
NOTE: this package was planned to be used, but due to time constraints was never
completed. This package contains nodes that define a [behavior tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)) for
controlling the rover during the Autonomous Navigation mission. The package makes
use of the [py_trees](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees) library.

## Limitations
This package was never completed, and as such has mot been tested thoroughly or
used on actual rover hardware. It may, however, contain some useful examples for
a developer using the py_trees.
